Dude looks like a lady
(That)
Cruised into a bar on the shore
Her picture graced the grime on the door
She's a long lost love at first bite
Baby, maybe you're wrong
But you know it's alright, that's right
Back stage we're having the time
Of our lives until somebody said
"Forgive me if I seem out of line"
Then she whipped out a gun
And tried to blow me away
Dude looks like a lady
(That, that)
Dude looks like a lady
(That, that)
Dude looks like a lady
(That, that)
Dude looks like a lady
So never judge a book by its cover
Or who you gonna love by your lover
Sayin', love put me wise to her love in disguise
She had the body of a Venus
Lord, imagine my surprise
Dude looks like a lady
(That, that)
Dude looks like a lady
(That, that)
Dude looks like a lady

Dude looks like a lady
Let me take a peek dear
(Baby, let me follow you down)
Do me, do me, do me all night
(Baby, let me follow you down)
Turn the other cheek, dear
(Baby, let him follow you down)
Do me, do me, do me, do me
Ooh, what a funky lady
Ooh, she like it, like it, like it, like that
Ooh, he was a lady, yeah
